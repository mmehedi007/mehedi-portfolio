            <h1>PEAKY BLINDERS</h1>
            <h2> Tomas Michael Shelby </h2>

            <p>Thomas Michael Shelby OBE DCM MM MP is the leader of the Birmingham criminal gang, the Peaky Blinders
                and the patriarch of the Shelby Family.

                Tommy served in World War I with the rank of Sergeant Major and was decorated for bravery. His
                experiences in World War I left him disillusioned and beset with ongoing nightmares, and he becomes
                determined to move his family up in the world.

                After the vendetta with the New York Mafia, and during the year of the Wall Street Crash, Thomas Shelby
                became a Member of Parliament as a socialist politician while lending the chair of the illegal business
                to his older brother, Arthur Shelby.</p>

                <h1 class="orange-colour"> Aurthor Shelby </h1>
                <p>Arthur is Thomas' elder brother and the two have a close but complex and strained relationship.
                    Thomas
                    uses the Peaky Blinders wealth and persuasion to purchase the Garrison, to which he entrusts to
                    Arthur's
                    management. He further involves his brother as 1/3 owner of Shelby Company Limited, proving the
                    relationship between the two to be a strong and trustful one.

                    Despite their closeness, Thomas shows no love for Arthur's actions and attempts at suicide. While he
                    forgives Arthur for giving their father £500 of the Peaky Blinder's money, he expresses contempt at
                    Arthur's failed attempt to hang himself, sarcastically suggesting that next time he shoot himself.
                    Furthermore, during Thomas' wedding where he prevents Arthur from saying his best mans' speech.</p>

                <h1 class="orange-colour">Jhon Shelby</h1>
                <p>John Michael Shelby, also known as Johnny or John Boy, was the third of Shelby siblings and a high
                    ranking member of the Peaky Blinders. He was also a 1/3 shareholder in the Shelby Family business,
                    Shelby Company Limited. He was the husband of Esme Shelby and therefore related to the Lee Family
                    through marriage.
                    After the Peaky Blinders get mixed up with the Changretta Family, John receives the Black Hand from
                    them, but is slow to react and misses a warning from his brother Tommy, and is shot to death in his
                    family estate.</p>
